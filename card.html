			<p>The body of a fox is build to offer it strength and speed. They are very slender animals with a long nose and pointed
				ears. Looking at these canines you wouldn’t expect them to have such characteristics. They have thin legs that are very
				strong and that can move quickly. The padding on the bottom of their feet allow them to cover any type of terrain without
				difficulty.

			<p>Cats have been domesticated for around 4,000 years. While they were once valued for their hunting abilities, they are
				now valued for their companionship and loving behaviour. Our domestic cats are known as little cats. They differ from
				large cats such as lions and tigers because they are naturally active at night and can purr. Cats are now the most popular
				pet in the UK and in the US. More cats are left-pawed than right.</p>
